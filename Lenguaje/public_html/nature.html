                <p>The Elche reservoir, declared an asset of Cultural Interest of the Valencian Community, is an area of great hydrological interest and high 
                environmental wealth for its reservoir, ravines and basins, irrigation channels and its picturesque aqueducts and, of course, the undoubted 
                star of the area: the imposing dam of 23 meters high and 62 meters of average curve radius, built on the Vinalopó river.</p>

                <p>El Clot de Galvany has been declared a Municipal Natural Area since 2005. It has an area of 355.84 ha.
                 It is a wetland, in which we can find a formation of meadows dominated by the albardín and the alcolechas.
                 In its landscape we can see old cultivation terraces and also, 2 bunkers from the civil war remain.
                 As for the fauna, it is represented by species in threat of extinction such as the gray teal, the brown poodle and the white-headed malvasia, 
                 along with others such as the little egret and the stilt.</p>

                 <p>The Hondo Natural Park, declared this way by the Generalitat Valenciana in 1994, is part of the old lagoon of Elche, created by the mouth of 
                 the Vinalopó River and almost completely dried out between the Middle Ages and the 18th century, to turn it into land arable.
                 It appears in the RAMSAR listings and is classified as a ZEPA (Special Protection Area for Birds) due to the relevance and abundance of 
                 its avifauna. 172 species have been counted.
                 Various walkways and observatories allow the visitor to see various corners of the park and observe the activity of the numerous birds.</p>
