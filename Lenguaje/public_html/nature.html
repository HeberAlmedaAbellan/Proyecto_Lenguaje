                <h2>Clot de Galvany (number 7 on the map)</h2>
                <p>El Clot de Galvany has been declared a Municipal Natural Area since 2005. It has an area of 355.84 ha.
                 It is a wetland, in which we can find a formation of meadows dominated by the albardín and the alcolechas.
                 In its landscape we can see old cultivation terraces and also, 2 bunkers from the civil war remain.
                 As for the fauna, it is represented by species in threat of extinction such as the gray teal, the brown poodle and the white-headed malvasia, 
                 along with others such as the little egret and the stilt.</p>

                 <h2>Salinas Natural Park (number 8 on the map)</h2>
                 <p> Las Salinas Natural Park is located south of Santa Pola. It is located on a littoral zone separated by a dune system with great biological and 
                    landscape importance.
                    The waters of this natural space are brackish, since it receives significant amounts of seawater to obtain salt. However, the lagoon also 
                    receives a small contribution of fresh or semi-sweet water.
                    The birdlife that inhabits this place is of special interest. Endangered species can be found. The colony of common flamingo (<em>Phoenicopterus ruber</em>) 
                    that stay in these lagoons during their migratory steps stands out.</p>

                 <p>The Elche reservoir, declared an asset of Cultural Interest of the Valencian Community, is an area of great hydrological interest and high 
                 environmental wealth for its reservoir, ravines and basins, irrigation channels and its picturesque aqueducts and, of course, the undoubted 
                 star of the area: the imposing dam of 23 meters high and 62 meters of average curve radius, built on the Vinalopó river.</p>

                 <h2>Hondo (number 10 on the map)</h2>
                 <p>The Hondo Natural Park, declared this way by the Generalitat Valenciana in 1994, is part of the old lagoon of Elche, created by the mouth of 
                 the Vinalopó River and almost completely dried out between the Middle Ages and the 18th century, to turn it into land arable.
                 It appears in the RAMSAR listings and is classified as a ZEPA (Special Protection Area for Birds) due to the relevance and abundance of 
                 its avifauna. 172 species have been counted.
                 Various walkways and observatories allow the visitor to see various corners of the park and observe the activity of the numerous birds.</p>
