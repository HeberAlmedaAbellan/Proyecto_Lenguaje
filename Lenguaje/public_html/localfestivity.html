                <h3>Holy Week</h3>
                <p>We can frame the beginning of the Holy Week processions in Elche at the end of the 16th century, placing its oldest antecedent in the year 1581, where there are documentary references stating that in that same year the Brotherhood of Blood was founded. de Cristo, which had its headquarters in the Chapel of the Hospital de la Caridad de la Villa. This brotherhood incorporated various images to its heritage, specifically, a Christ Tied to the Column, the Ecce-Homo and a Nazarene Christ, later and in the aforementioned sixteenth century to complete the scenes of the Passion, in the Good Friday Procession , the Image of the Virgin of Solitude, patron saint of the nobles of Elche and the Image of the Holy Christ that was venerated in the Church of Santa María were incorporated.

                Currently, thirty-one Brotherhoods or Brotherhoods participate in Ilicitana Holy Week, made up of more than six thousand seven hundred brothers, carrying out thirty-three processions which take place from the morning of Palm Sunday to the morning of Easter Sunday.

                 <h3>Moors and Christians</h3>
                 <p> The Moors and Christians festival was born as a commemoration of the period of Muslim power in the Iberian Peninsula and the battles that alternated power between Muslims and Christians. It is celebrated from August 7 to 11 and is the first act in honor of Our Lady of the Assumption, patron saint of the city. It is a massive representation that commemorates the Christian reconquest of the city. It is made up of the participation of twelve comparsas, six of them belonging to the Moro side and as many to the Christian side, each one made up of several hundred participants of both sexes.

                 <h3>"Nit de l'Albà"</h3>
                 <p>The night of August 13 is the Nit de l’Albà, one of the most anticipated celebrations by the people of Elche. Tonight, hundreds of pyrotechnic devices dress the night with light, color and sound. This festival, very characteristic of the city, has its origin in the Middle Ages, in which families offered to the Virgin with a rocket for each of their children. Today that tradition has led to the launching of hundreds of palm trees that are launched in a coordinated and alternate way from different parts of the city. In addition, citizens acquire and launch fireworks individually and spontaneously during the duration of the fire shower.

                The rockets and fireworks occur from 11 pm to minutes before midnight. At that moment, the pyrotechnic activity ceases, the city lights go out and the people of Elche wait in silence for the most important moment of the night, while the most significant fragment of the Misteri d'Elx plays in the background: “the Gloria Patri”. In the middle of the darkness, the Virgin's palm rises, a large palm tree of white light that is launched from the Basilica of Santa María, and that completely illuminates, for a few seconds, the entire sky of the city.
