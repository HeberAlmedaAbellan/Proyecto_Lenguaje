                        <p>It is the scene of the Misteri d’Elx and is located in the place that the main mosque occupied in Muslim times. After the conquest of the city by Jaume I
                           in 1265, the first Catholic temple was built on it, the current one began to be built in 1672 under the orders of Francesc Verde and was completed in 
                           1784. Its plan is of a Latin cross with a large nave central and four chapels on each side with perforated buttresses. On the transept there is a large 
                           dome covered by blue tiles on the outside. You can follow the different styles, from the first attempt to overcome the disorganized style, to the pure 
                           neoclassical, passing through the decorative Italian baroque of its Asunción façade, one of the most beautiful of the Valencian baroque. Both this façade
                           and the Saint Agatángelo portal are the works of the Strasbourg sculptor, Nicolás de Bussi (1680-1682).</p>
